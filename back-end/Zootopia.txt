Plot[edit]
In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps from rural Bunnyburrow fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban Zootopia. Despite being the academy valedictorian, Judy is delegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.

The next day, Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of crocus bulbs known as Midnicampum holicithias. Bogo reprimands her, but Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who are missing. When Judy volunteers and Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment, Bogo gives her 48 hours to find Otterton on the condition that she resigns if she fails.

After determining Nick was a suspect seen in Otterton's last known sighting, Judy blackmails him into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion with her carrot pen. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went "savage" – reverted to a feral state – and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about "night howlers" before the attack. Moments later, Manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but when they arrive, Manchas has vanished. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick reminds Bogo that Judy still has ten hours to solve the case. Judy learns from Nick that he was bullied as a child when he tried to join the Ranger Scouts, who stereotyped him as untrustworthy for being a fox.

At City Hall, Bellwether offers Judy and Nick access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the "night howlers". They locate the missing predators - all gone savage - imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Mayor Leodore Lionheart hides them from the public while a scientist tries to determine the cause of their behavior. Lionheart and those involved are arrested for false imprisonment and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.

Judy, praised for solving the case, has become friends with Nick and asks him to join the ZPD as her partner. However, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a predatory biological cause for the recent savage behavior, and her comments cause tension between predators and prey throughout the city. Feeling guilty for the results of her words, Judy quits her job.

Back in Bunnyburrow, Judy learns that the night howlers are actually toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals. After returning to Zootopia and reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who tells them the bulbs he stole were for a ram named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway, developing a drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a dart gun.

Judy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and takes the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Judy and Nick are trapped after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. Bellwether shoots a serum pellet at Nick to make him kill Judy, and summons the ZPD for help, but Judy and Nick have replaced the serum pellets in Bellwether's gun with blueberries. Enraged, Bellwether threatens to frame the pair for the attacks, but Judy has recorded Bellwether's confession. Bogo and the ZPD arrive and Bellwether is arrested.

Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of Bellwether's plot and states that his imprisonment of the savage predators was a "wrong thing for the right reason". With the cause of the epidemic identified, the savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.

Production[edit]
Writing[edit]
Development of the film that would come to be called Zootopia began when Byron Howard pitched six story ideas to Disney Animation chief creative officer and executive producer John Lasseter, of which three involved animal characters: an all-animal adaptation of The Three Musketeers, a 1960s-themed story about a "mad doctor cat...who turned children into animals," and a "bounty hunter pug in space."[37] The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney’s Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles.[38] According to Howard, Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. His concept, in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals, was well received by Lasseter, who responded by embracing and lifting Howard "in the air like a baby Simba."[39] Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the 1960s theme with the animal characters, especially the space pug.[37] This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas, an international spy film centered on an Artic Hare named "Jack Savage" who was somewhat like James Bond.[37][40] It was around this time that screenwriter Jared Bush was hired to work on the film; he was excited to work on a spy film because his own father and grandfather had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.[37]

Howard and Bush continued to develop the film with the assistance of the Disney Story Trust, the studio's top creative personnel who meet regularly to review and discuss all projects in development.[40] The most delightful part of the spy film turned out to be its first act, set in a city created by and for animals.[37] To focus on the all-animal city, Howard eventually dropped the 1960s setting, along with the espionage and international aspects, which caused the film to evolve into a contemporary police procedural in which Nick Wilde was the lead role and Judy Hopps was essentially his sidekick.[37][40][41] For a while, "the filmmakers were very committed" to that version of the story,[40] but then in November 2014, the filmmakers realized the film's plot would be more engaging if they reversed the roles to instead focus on Hopps as opposed to Wilde.[41] The change in perspective caused several characters to be dropped, including two characters known as "The Gerbil Jerks" who were described as "trust-fund gerbils that had nothing better to do than harass Nick."[42]

Pre-production[edit]
Byron Howard
Rich Moore
Directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore presented footage from the film at the 2015 Annecy International Animated Film Festival[43]
In May 2013, The Hollywood Reporter initially reported that Howard was directing the film and that Jason Bateman had been cast, but little else about the film was known at the time.[15] Zootopia was first officially announced in August 2013 at the D23 Expo, with a March 2016 release date.[38][44]

Research for the film took place in Disney's Animal Kingdom, as well as in Kenya and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where animators spent eight months studying various animals' walk cycles as well as fur color.[45][46] 800,000 forms of mammals were created for and featured in the film.[46] To make the characters' fur even more realistic, they also went to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to closely observe the appearance of fur with a microscope under a variety of lighting.[47][46] The filmmakers drew inspiration for Zootopia's urban design from major cities including New York City, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Brasília.[48] To develop a city that could actually be inhabited by talking mammals ranging in size from two inches (5 cm) to 27 feet (8.23 m) and from drastically different climates, the filmmakers consulted Americans with Disabilities Act specialists and HVAC system designers.[49] For assistance with designing motor vehicles appropriate for so many different types and sizes of mammals, the filmmakers consulted with J Mays, former chief creative officer of the Ford Motor Company.[50] During the development process, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn suggested that Nick should expressly state his disappointment ("Just when I thought someone actually believed in me...") after discovering that Judy still fears him as a predator.[51] In March 2015, it was revealed that Rich Moore (Wreck-It Ralph) had been added as a director of the film, in addition to Jared Bush (Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero) as co-director.[52]

Animation[edit]
Disney's most recent work on animating fur was for the titular character of the 2008 film Bolt, but the software they had used at the time was not ready for creating the realistic fur of the animals of Zootopia. Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software iGroom, which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen "imaginary" underlayer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on Elsa's head in Frozen.[46]

Zootopia was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on Big Hero 6. A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals' dense fur. Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of Wreck-It Ralph, was used to make the fur more consistent, intact and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character. The tree-and-plant generator Bonsai, first used in Frozen, was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage.[46]

Zootopia was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in North Hollywood (together with Moana) while Disney Animation's headquarters in Burbank was being renovated.[53]

Casting[edit]
On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps.[14] The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring "a funny yet heartfelt side" with "a wily, dry-witted sort of voice." Bateman described his character as "a crafty, sarcastic schemer," remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: "'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they just looked at me like I was an idiot and said, 'Just do what you do. Just talk.'"[54]

Commenting on the casting of Goodwin, Moore said that she brought "very centered sweetness, tremendous heart and a great sense of humor"; he described Judy as "a little Pollyanna mixed with Furiosa." Goodwin stated about her character: "People mistake kindness for naivete or stupidity, and she is a good girl through and through. But she's not a dumb bunny."[54]

Release and alternative titles[edit]
Zootopia was released in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D, making it the first Disney animated film shown in domestic IMAX theatres since Treasure Planet (2002).[9][10] The film was retitled for theatrical release across several international territories. In the United Kingdom and other European, Middle Eastern, and North African countries, the film was renamed Zootropolis, a reference to the concept of a 'metropolis' rather than to that of a 'utopia'; all lines that include "Zootopia" were also redubbed.[60][61][62] In China, the state's SAPPRFT granted the film a rare two-week extension to play in theaters in addition to its limited 30-day run, which was to have ended on April 3.[63] In Germany, the film was titled Zoomania due to a children's book by German author Kay Fischer with the same name released in 2010.[64][65]

Zootopia grossed $341.3 million in the U.S. and Canada and $682.5 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $1.024 billion, against a budget of $150 million.[4][5] On March 18, 2016, the film reached the $500 million mark, becoming the third consecutive Walt Disney Animation Studios film to reach the milestone after Frozen (2013) and Big Hero 6 (2014).[74][75] On April 5, it became the first film of 2016 to gross over $800 million in ticket sales,[76] and on April 24, became the first ever film of 2016 to cross $900 million.[77] On June 5, the film crossed the $1 billion mark, becoming the second film of 2016 to do so (after the studio's own Captain America: Civil War), the fourth animated film (after Toy Story 3, Frozen, and Minions), the eleventh Disney film (third Disney animated film), and the twenty-sixth film overall to break the milestone.[78]

Worldwide, it was the fourth highest-grossing film of 2016 (behind Civil War, Rogue One, and Finding Dory),[79] the second highest-grossing animated film of 2016,[79] the second highest-grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios film (second highest overall) of all time in its original release (after Frozen),[76] the second highest-grossing original film (behind Avatar),[80] the fifth highest-grossing animated film of all time, and the 28th highest-grossing film of all time. Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $294.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the 5th most profitable release of 2016.[81]

North America[edit]
In the United States and Canada, pre-release tracking suggested the film would open to $60–70 million from 3,827 theaters in its opening weekend.[82][83] It played in 3,100 3D theaters, 365 IMAX theaters, and 325 premium large format screens.[82] It earned $1.7 million from Thursday previews, a record for a non-Pixar Disney animated film,[84] for an animated film opening outside of summer,[85] and seventh biggest all-time for an animated film.[86] Buoyed by good word of mouth, it earned $19.5 million on its opening day, also a record for a non-Pixar Disney animated film (breaking Frozen's record),[84] and the second biggest for a March animated film (behind Ice Age: The Meltdown).[87] In its opening weekend, it scored a better than expected $75.1 million, which was the biggest non-Pixar Disney animated opening (breaking Big Hero 6's record), the biggest opening weekend among Walt Disney Animation Studios films (breaking Frozen's record), the biggest March animated opening (breaking The Lorax's record), the seventh biggest March opening, and the tenth biggest animated opening of all time.[88][89][90] Furthermore, its opening weekend is also the fourth biggest for an original film, behind The Secret Life of Pets, Inside Out, and Avatar.[91][92] It also performed exceptionally well in IMAX, where the film brought in $5.2 million from 366 screens, the second best animated IMAX opening behind only Toy Story 3 ($8.4 million).[89]

In its second weekend, it fell gradually by 31% to $51.3 million and recorded one of the best holds for an animated film, more or less on par with Wreck-It Ralph's second weekend drop of 32%, but a bigger drop than The Lego Movie's 27%.[93] It continued to top the box office for the third weekend, earning $37.2 million, falling by 28% from its previous weekend while passing the $200 million mark.[94] This made it the second biggest third weekend for a film that did not open at over $100 million, behind Avatar ($68 million) and ahead of Skyfall ($35 million).[95] The film was overtaken by the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in its fourth weekend, despite only a marginal decline.[96] It spent a total of 13 consecutive weeks in the top ten, more than any other film except for Avatar (14 weeks) and Frozen (16 weeks) over the last decade.[80]

It ended its theatrical run on August 4, 2016, after playing in theaters for a total of 154 days.[5] It became the second highest-grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios film (behind Frozen),[97] the seventh highest-grossing film of 2016,[98] and the tenth highest-grossing animated film of all time.[99]

Outside North America[edit]
Internationally, Zootopia received a scattered release as Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures took advantage of school holidays in various markets. The film opened in a limited number of international markets in the weekend ending February 14, earning $4.5 million in three markets.[100] It expanded to 22 markets in its second weekend, into 36% of its total international markets, and added $31.2 million.[101] It added another $33 million in its third weekend with no new markets.[102] In its fourth weekend, it expanded to 45 countries and grossed $64.7 million, coming in second place at the international box office, behind the Chinese film Ip Man 3.[103] $3.3 million came from IMAX showings.[103] It finally topped the box office in its fifth weekend after a strong second weekend gross in China.

Zootopia's largest markets overseas are China ($235.6 million), followed by Japan ($70.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($39.2 million), Germany ($34.2 million), the UK ($34.2 million), France ($31.9 million), and South Korea ($31.6 million).[112][113][114] In China, it is the highest-grossing Disney film in local currency (¥1.530 billion), surpassing Avengers: Age of Ultron (¥1.464 billion), as well as the seventh highest-grossing film of all time.[115][116] In Russia, it is the second highest-grossing film of all time in local currency (₽2.3 billion), behind only Avatar (₽3.6 billion).[117] It topped the Russian and German box office for three weekends,[118][119] and the Chinese and Korean box office for two weekends.[120][121]

In China, where it was locally known as Crazy Animal City (疯狂动物城),[62] the film exceeded expectations[122] and was considered Hollywood's biggest breakout success in China since 2015's Jurassic World made $229 million.[123] It had an opening day of $3.4 million on its way to $23.6 million for its three-day opening weekend, debuting in second place and scoring the biggest non-sequel animated opening, as well as the second biggest three-day opening and IMAX opening for an animated film, behind Kung Fu Panda 3.[103] In its ninth day of release (a Saturday), it recorded the biggest single-day gross ever for an animated film, with $25 million (compared to $10.6 million on its first Saturday), and passed the lifetime total of Big Hero 6 to become the highest-grossing Disney animated film in China.[124][125] In its second weekend, it grossed $60 million,[126] an enormous increase of 139% from its previous weekend, and crossed the $100 million mark to become the third animated film in China to do so, after Kung Fu Panda 3 and Monkey King: Hero Is Back. This also marked the single best weekend for an animated film.[104] In mid-March, the combined total of Kung Fu Panda 3 and Zootopia alone broke 2014's record of $286 million in box office grosses for American animated features in China.[127] In its third weekend, it grossed $40 million for a total of $175 million, making it the highest-grossing animated film of all time in China.[128] On March 27, its seventeenth day of release, it passed the $200 million mark, becoming the first animated film, the second Disney film, and the sixth Hollywood film overall to pass that milestone.[106] It became the highest-grossing animated film of all time and the second highest-grossing film of 2016, behind only The Mermaid.[129]

It opened in Japan on April 23[130] and earned $4 million in its opening weekend, debuting at second place in the box office, behind Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare,[131][132] and had the third biggest Walt Disney Animation Studios debut in that market, behind Frozen and Big Hero 6.[77] Deadline.com pointed out that the average opening number might have been due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes, which could have affected moviegoers.[77] In a rare achievement, it topped the box office in its third weekend after two weeks at No. 2.[133] In the following two weekends, it continued to increase its ticket sales,[134] and topped the box office there for four consecutive weekends.[135][136] After four straight wins, it was finally overtaken by the R-rated superhero film Deadpool.[137] It was the No. 1 western/Hollywood film for eight consecutive weekends.[138] The Hollywood Reporter cited that strong word of mouth, audiences watching both the English and Japanese versions, and 3D and 4DX screenings, as well as a popular Japanese version of the "Try Everything" song by Dream Ami, all helped boost Zootopia's performance.[135] Its strong run in the market aided the film to propel past the $1 billion mark worldwide.[139] It remained in top three for 11 consecutive weekends and has grossed a total of $70.1 million there.[140][141][142]

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 254 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "The brilliantly well-rounded Zootopia offers a thoughtful, inclusive message that's as rich and timely as its sumptuously state-of-the-art animation – all while remaining fast and funny enough to keep younger viewers entertained."[11] It was the site's second highest-rated film of 2016 behind Moonlight.[143] On Metacritic, the film has a normalized score of 78 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[144] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.[145][84]

Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times considered the movie "funny, smart, [and] thought-provoking."[146] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Zootopia "may be the most subversive movie of" 2016, giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praising its timely message about the harm of prejudice in the face of the prevailing xenophobic political rhetoric at the time of the film's release, and the film's humor.[12] Peter Debruge at Variety opined that Zootopia "plays directly to the studio's strengths."[147] IGN reviewer Eric Goldman gave the film a 9.0 out of 10 'Amazing' score, saying "Zootopia is a wonderful example of how Disney, at its best, can mix its past and present together in a very cool, compelling way. It takes the classic animation trope of animals walking, talking and acting like humans, but gives it a modern spin both in terms of its humor and animation style ... and also in its themes, which are meaningful and fascinatingly topical."[148]

Writing in British Sunday newspaper The Observer, reviewer Mark Kermode found the film to be a "very funny, and very likable holiday treat." He added, "The ensuing drama is nominally a tale of predators succumbing to their animal instincts while frightened prey fear their neighbours. In fact, it's a delightfully well-orchestrated parable about trust and tolerance versus panic and prejudice. An encouragingly upbeat celebration of love and diversity in times of hate and uncertainty. If that all sounds overly on-message, then fear not – the jokes are funny, the characters engaging, and the animation packed with delicious visual detail," before concluding, "[…] this is proper family fun with genuine cross-generational appeal. Hooray!"[149]

In the UK daily newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin noted, "The lion doesn't just lie down with the lamb, they run for City Hall on a joint ticket. It's the diversity dream come true. Or is it? […] Think Busytown by way of Chinatown. It's almost certain to be the most existentially probing talking animal cartoon of the year." Collin added, "Like Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs., albeit considerably cuter, Judy and Nick make a hilariously strained but effective double act – not least thanks to Goodwin and Bateman's tremendous vocal work, which trips along with the effortless swing and snap of great bebop."[150]

Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, despite generally liking the film (three out of four stars), had trouble with the film's central metaphor that conflicted with its message, stating that "[Zootopia] is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, and not use species-ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions.... This all seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various animals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one: carnivores eat herbivores because it's in their nature." He ended his review pointing out that "if [Zootopia] were a bit vaguer, or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, it might have been a classic, albeit of a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it's a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that doesn't add up in the way it wants to."[151]

Also in The Daily Telegraph, Rosa Prince singled out the film's lead character, Judy Hopps, as a welcome change for Disney animated feature film heroines, such as the Disney Princess franchise. She found that unlike those characters' focus on romance or family loyalty, Hopps' focus is on her dream career as a police officer and serving her city.[152]

The film was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of 2016,[153] and won the Academy Award, Golden Globe, Critics' Choice Movie Award and Annie Award for Best Animated Feature Film, as well as receiving a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film.[154][155]

Lawsuit[edit]
On March 21, 2017, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed against Disney by Esplanade Productions, a company owned by Gary L. Goldman, the co-screenwriter of Total Recall. The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled Looney, which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called Zootopia. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo. A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being "ridden with patently false allegations."[156] After months of back-and-forth deliberation between the two parties, U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald dismissed the infringement claims on November 8, 2017. As stated in the final review, "...Goldman's effort to make the plots of Looney and Zootopia seem similar were strained. All the purported similarities between the two works were themes, not plot points or sequences of events, that were too general to be protected by copyright law."[157][158]
