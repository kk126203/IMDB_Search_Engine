The film is a sequel to 2015's Wolf Warrior. It was released in China on 27 July 2017.[2][6] The film tells a story of a loose cannon Chinese soldier named Leng Feng who takes on special missions around the world. In this sequel, he finds himself in an African country protecting medical aid workers from local rebels and vicious arms dealers.

Wolf Warrior 2 received general praise for its patriotic plot, special effects, action sequences and the cast's performances. It was a massive commercial success and has become the highest-grossing Chinese film ever released. The film broke numerous box office records, including the biggest single-day gross for a Chinese film as well as the fastest film to cross RMB 2 billion, 3 billion, 4 billion and 5 billion box office marks. It also became the fastest film to surpass US$500 million and the first film to gross more than US$600 million at the Chinese box office. At a total domestic gross of CN¥5.67 billion (USD$870.3 million),[7] it is the 2nd highest-grossing film of all-time in a single market behind only Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($936.7 million in North America), and having exceeded North America's totals from Avatar ($760 million), Titanic ($659 million) and Jurassic World ($652 million).[8][9][10] The film is currently the fifth highest-grossing film of 2017 at US$870.3 million, making it the 55th highest grossing film worldwide.[11][12] It is the first and only non-Hollywood film ever to be included in the list of 100 all-time highest-grossing films worldwide.[13][14] It was selected as the Chinese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards.[15]

A sequel, titled Wolf Warrior 3 (Chinese: 战狼3), has been confirmed by Wu Jing.[16]


Plot[edit]
After the events of Wolf Warrior, Leng Feng and members of his special-ops team brings his comrade's remains back to his home town and his comrade's family for his funeral, only to see it on the verge of being torn down completely. A real estate company is pulling down his comrade's family and his house during the funeral. The boss of the real estate company confronts them with a gun and sneers at them presenting the remains to the family, only for the boss to be kicked to the ground. The boss calls for his henchmen to attack them but they are all swiftly disabled by the Feng and the other soldiers. Police arrive shortly after and ask Leng Feng to put down the gun he confiscated from the boss. The boss gets back up and boasts that he will "make the family wish they were dead" to Feng, enraging him to a point that he kicks the boss in the stomach, sending him crashing onto a police car's windshield, killing him. This results in him being sent to a military prison for two years and being discharged from the Chinese army.

After being released from prison, Feng leaves for Africa, planning to wander for the rest of his life. Serving as a mercenary providing security aboard a freighter delivering relief supplies to Africa, he foils an attempted hijacking by Somalian pirates by swimming towards their skiff and defeating the pirates in hand-to-hand combat underwater. The freighter arrives safely at its destination. Feng has been carrying a bullet which he found, a clue to his fiancée's kidnapping that happened while she was on a mission, for three years.

Feng and some locals party one day on a beach but they are attacked by rebel forces who are aiming to overthrow the government of the African nation. Shortly after the arrival of the Rebels and mercenaries who overrun the government troops, the Chinese fleet arrives to evacuate Chinese nationals caught up in the middle of the civil war, but after overhearing guards talking about needing someone to rescue workers at a factory and an important doctor who knows the vaccination for Lamanla (Dr Chen), Leng Feng volunteers. However, he is on his own as without the Chinese armies higher authorities' permission no other personnel can follow him as they are on foreign grounds. He travels to the hospital, 60 kilometres away from the dock and enters the hospital building just as Dr Chen is killed by the mercenaries, accidentally. With his few dying breaths, Dr Chen tells him to take his daughter, an African girl named Pasha. Together they, alongside a female doctor Rachel Smith, escape the grips of the mercenaries, but with cut-backs. While escaping, he cuts his hand in a pile of Lamanla infected bodies, but he shakes it off and moves on. They continue their journey of saving the Chinese as Leng Feng also goes to save his good friend's mother, who's working in the Hanbound factory.

Upon arriving at the Hanbound factory, Feng is confronted by the security, and the factory's owner's son, Zhou Yifan, a cocky fuerdai who is also an army fanatic.

A promotional poster showed Leng Feng giving the middle finger with the slogan "Anyone who offends China, no matter how remote, must be exterminated."[20]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
Wolf Warrior 2 became a huge commercial success at the Chinese box office, and also in countries such as Australia and Malaysia where there were reports of sold out tickets.[23][24][25] The film was noted for showing incredible legs at the box office despite being a tent pole movie earning seven times its prequel[26] and five times distributor's initial estimates.[27] It topped the international box office for all major films on three separate occasions – in its first three weekends.[28][29][30][31] Its unprecedented success has been attributed to various reasons such as its patriotic subject, nationalistic themes, and its bona-fide action sequences and stunts that have been said to be a breakthrough for Chinese films. The film was also released during the annual summer "blackout period" in which foreign movies are not released, and it only had to compete with other domestic movies.[32][33] It became the highest-grossing film in China after just twelve days of release, overtaking The Mermaid which held the record for six months. However, the records that the film broke were not just limited to its domestic market. It also became the biggest film released in a single territory in 2017, breaking Beauty and the Beast's record of US$504 million and the biggest summer release of the year in a single territory, ahead of Wonder Woman (US$400 million).[21] As a result, it became the tenth film to earn over US$500 million in a single territory and the sixth film to make over US$600 million, and the third film to pass the US$700 million threshold following Avatar and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[34] It is also the fastest film to reach the CN¥2 billion, CN¥3 billion, CN¥4 billion and CN¥5 billion marks in China, doing so on its eighth, eleventh, seventeenth and twenty-third day respectively and became the first film to earn more than CN¥200 million (est. US$30 million) for twelve consecutive days globally (tied with Star Wars: The Force Awakens[35]). It has so far grossed a total of CN¥5 billion (US$716.5 million), which includes online ticketing fees, or around US$768.5 million dollars with online surcharges[36][37][38][39] and is among the top 100 highest-grossing films of all time, unadjusted for inflation.[40][41] Due to the film's rising popularity and strong holds, analysts believe the film could end up making CN¥5 billion (US$747 million) to CN¥6 billion (US$895 million) at the Chinese box office alone.[21][42][43][44]

It opened in China on Thursday 27 July 2017, across 19,000+ screens, occupying 42% of the nation's total screens and earned CN¥212 million (US$31.4 million) on its opening day. Including previews, the total stood at CN¥313 million (US$46.4 million). After four hours of advanced screenings Thursday evening brought in CN¥100 million ($US14.9 million) in ticket sales, phenomenal word-of-mouth quickly grew and made its way to the social media.[45] This resulted in the film posting an opening of CN¥975 million (US$144.5 million) – or CN¥921 million (US$136.7 million) without online ticketing fees – through Sunday,[46][47] and US$125 million from Friday to Sunday. The latter figure is the biggest three day opening, ahead of The Mermaid which opened to US$122.3 million in the same number of days.[48] This made it the top film released that weekend worldwide, even ahead of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk.[29] As a result of excellent reviews and strong word-of-mouth, the film's Sunday take rose 15% from Saturday's, a rare feat in a country where the biggest films are usually the most front-loaded. Also, its Sunday-Monday drop was just 35% and the screen count rose from 19,000+ to 24,000 (52%).[47]

On Monday, it made CN¥279 million (US$41.5 million), a fall of just 35% from its Sunday take and registered the biggest Monday ever in a single territory ahead of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (US$40.1 million). This pushed the film past the CN¥1 billion threshold with a total of CN¥1.265 billion (US$187.8 million).[49][50] This was followed by the biggest Tuesday with CN¥282 million (US$42 milliin), also ahead of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (US$37 million)[51][52] and the fifth biggest Wednesday with CN¥278 million (US$41.4 million).[53][54] By Thursday, the film had earned past CN¥2 billion, the fastest film to do so in the least amount of time.[55]

In just ten days, the film grossed CN¥2.73 billion (US$406 million) to become the biggest release of 2017 there, surpassing The Fate of the Furious (CN¥2.6 billion) and the second highest-grossing film ever, behind only The Mermaid (CN¥3.39 billion).[48] The film's demand was so strong that it made more in its second weekend than the first. Earning a total of CN¥1.092 billion (US$162.2 million), an increase of 30% from the previous weekend, it also set a new record for the biggest ever second weekend in a single territory, surpassing the previous record holder Star Wars: The Force Awakens (US$149 million). The 30% weekend-to-weekend hike is among the top ten smallest second weekend drop, and the smallest for a non-Hollywood production. The same weekend it passed the CN¥3 billion threshold with a total of CN¥3.159 billion (US$470.4 million) becoming the second Chinese film to reach the mark after The Mermaid.[56][57][58][59] On 7 August 2017, it became the biggest ever Chinese film released just after twelve days of release. Similarly, The Mermaid overtook Monster Hunt in February 2016 after twelve days.[21] The film began to shed a considerable number of theatres by its third weekend mainly to make room for new releases such as Guilty of Mind, The Adventurers and Legend of the Naga Pearls,[37] resulting in the film falling by 49% earning another CN¥523 million (US$78.5 million), though still maintaining the top spot.[38] Twenty five days after the film's release, it surpassed Avatar to become the second highest-grossing film in a single-territory and is behind only Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It topped the box office charts in China for four consecutive weekends,[60][61] or a record breaking thirty consecutive days. It was eventually overtaken by French film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets on its thirty-first day. At that time, Valerian played 78,000 times while Wolf Warrior 2 was still screened 32,500 times.[62][63]

Critical response[edit]
Wolf Warrior 2 received praise for its patriotic plot, special effects, action sequences and the cast's performances.[64] On Douban, the film scored 7.6 versus the previous film’s 6.8. On Mtime, it’s at 7.5 versus 7.[48][65]

Domestically, film critic Zhang Chuan argues that "the film is a decent Chinese one in visual effects, story telling, action scenes", and it is "comparable to Hollywood's in terms of these aspects" [66] Wenhui Daily considered the film to be a milestone in the history of Chinese cinema with "stories, connotations, and structures".[67] Due to its patriotic themes and positive portrayal of the Chinese military, it also received high praises from China's state owned and miltiary-affiliated media. However, the reception is not uniformly positive, with many varying responses to the film.[68] Yin Shanshan, a lecturer at the Central Academy of Drama, a top drama school in China, criticized the film as excessively violent and "psychopathic, worthless, without values or logic" on her Sina Weibo account.[69][70][71]

Internationally, The Hollywood Reporter reads, "The star's charisma is enhanced by his athletic prowess, which makes the hand-to-hand combat particularly arresting, especially a brutal brawl between him and Grillo that provides a fitting climax. The breathless pacing thankfully doesn't allow much time for viewers to ponder the plot holes or worry about character development, although the two-hour running time results in overkill fatigue."[72] Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies Chinese society and cinema, said to New York Times, “It’s a very individualist personal quest, which is much more of a Hollywood thing. They’re definitely downplaying the Communist Party in favor of patriotism and defending Chinese people and Chinese interests all over the world."[73] Rob Hunter of the Film School Rejects, in his positive review of the film, wrote: "Wolf Warrior 2 still suffers some of the same issues that dogged the first film, but the improvements elsewhere make for a noticeably better and more entertaining action movie. It's a fun movie blending lots of action, some humor, and "feelings" for friends and family, and if the next one improves at this same rate Wolf Warrior 3 is going to be something even more special."[74] In a less enthusiastic review, Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the "blandly generic" film features digital effects that "look fake," but praised its stunts and pointed out "it’s fascinating to see a film so closely mimic big-budget Hollywood war pictures, but from an opposing socio-political perspective."[75] However, Lily Kuo of the Quartz criticized the film just a Chinese version of White Savior, and many specifics about its African setting are irrelevant. No name of the African country where the story took place was even mentioned in the film, as Kuo pointed out.[76] Clifford Coonan of the Irish Times believed that the popularity of the film reflected China's thirst for expanding of its military forces aboard, as it was released after China established its first overseas naval base in Djibouti.[77] Wu's Leng Feng has been compared to Sylvester Stallone's 1980s action hero John Rambo, with some noting the coincidence of Wolf Warrior 2 to China's aggressive foreign policy under General Secretary Xi Jinping.[78][79][80]
