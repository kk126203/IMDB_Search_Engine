The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics[7] and has grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2017, the fourth highest-grossing animated film of all time and the 24th highest-grossing overall. It is Illumination's second film to gross over $1 billion, after Minions in 2015, becoming the first ever animated franchise to do so.

Plot[edit]
Former villain Gru is now an agent for the Anti-Villain League (AVL). He and his partner/wife Lucy are sent to foil the plans of Balthazar Bratt, a former child star turned evil. Gru manages to stop Bratt from stealing the world's largest diamond, but is unable to capture him. As a result of failing to capture Bratt, Gru and Lucy are fired from the AVL by its unreasonable new director Valerie Da Vinci, following the retirement of Silas Ramsbottom.

Gru and Lucy reluctantly tell their children, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, of their termination, but assure them they will find new jobs. Most of Gru's Minions leave Gru when he refuses to return to villainy despite losing his job. Meanwhile, Lucy struggles to adapt to her new role as the children's new mom. The next morning, the family is approached by Fritz, the butler of Gru's cheerful twin brother Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia and longs to meet him. Gru is shocked to learn he has a twin. He confronts his mother, who reveals that when she and her husband divorced, they agreed to keep one child each. The family decides to travel to meet Dru, and they are surprised at his immense wealth, which Fritz attributes to their pig farm business. Meanwhile, the Minions are arrested for trespassing at a talent show set. Bratt manages to steal the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot and destroy Hollywood as revenge for the cancellation of his show.

Dru reveals to Gru that their recently deceased father was a legendary supervillain, whose villainous activities are the real source of the family's wealth. As Dru was dismissed by their father as a disgrace, he asks his brother to teach him how to be a villain. When Gru refuses to revert to his old ways, Dru takes him on a joyride around Freedonia in their father's technologically advanced car and the siblings bond. Meanwhile, Lucy tries to balance her tasks as a mom, which she exhibits after turning away a young boy named Niko who had fallen for Margo in the midst of a traditional cheese festival, while Edith and Agnes stumble into a local tavern and learn from the bartender about a mythical unicorn which lurks in a nearby forest. Gru tries to convince Agnes that unicorns are imaginary, but decides against it to avoid hurting her feelings. The next day, Agnes and Edith set out into the woods to track the mythical horse, only to find a one-horned goat whom Agnes adopts and dubs "Lucky." Meanwhile, the Minions' longing for Gru motivates them to escape from prison.

Dru convinces Gru to steal the diamond, with Gru secretly intending to bring it to the AVL, which he hopes will convince Da Vinci to rehire him. Despite several setbacks, they manage to retrieve the diamond and are rescued by Lucy after narrowly escaping. After finding out Gru's true motives, Dru confronts his brother about his lie. In return, Gru insults him and decides to leave Freedonia. Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the children, and once again acquires the diamond. Gru and Dru resolve their differences and pursue him.

With his robot powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, intending to send it into space with the use of superpowered gum. Lucy saves the children while Gru and Dru weaken Bratt's robot with the weapons of their father's car. Gru is knocked unconscious when the car is destroyed, and Dru manages to destroy the robot's core from the inside when Bratt threatens to kill Gru. When Gru recovers, he battles Bratt in a dance fight, using it as a distraction to grab his weaponized keytar, and defeats him. Having rendezvoused with Gru, the Minions manage to destroy the gum already covering the city, and Gru and Dru reunite.

Soon afterward, Gru and Lucy are reinstated in the AVL and the newly united family celebrate in Gru's home. Lucy is acknowledged by the children as their mother. Lured back to villainy, Dru and most of the minions steals Gru's ship, with Gru's emblem replaced with a "D" graffiti. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging pursuit.

Reception[edit]
Critical response[edit]
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 166 reviews, and an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Despicable Me 3 should keep fans of the franchise consistently entertained with another round of colorful animation and zany—albeit somewhat scattershot—humor."[29] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 49 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[30] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.[31]

IGN gave the film a score of 6/10, saying, "It’s not much, but Despicable Me 3 is at least enough for the younger fans of the franchise."[32] Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, "Despicable Me 3 is unwieldy, but it mostly works, as co-directors Pierre Coffin (who also voices the Minions) and Kyle Balda never lose sight of the film's emotional center, packing the rest with as much humor as they can manage. The jokes come so fast and furious, the movie can hardly find room for Heitor Pereira's funky score, and though Pharrell Williams has contributed five new songs to sell soundtracks (including the sweet There's Something Special), the movie hardly needs them."[33] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a mixed review, saying: "Ultimately, none of these flaws will matter to the throngs of little kids who have made the previous Despicable Me movies (and the superior Minions spin-off) into giant global hits."[34]

Sandy Schaefer for Screen Rant gives the film a 3 out of 5 stars saying "Despicable Me 3 offers enough in the way of zany, irreverent entertainment (with a dose of heart) to please steadfast fans of the franchise."[35] Jordan Mintzer for The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review saying "This rather clever, breakneck-paced cartoon gives fans exactly what they want: Like the new nemesis voiced by Trey Parker, it shoots mulitple machine-gun bursts of bubblegum at the audience, asking them to chew and enjoy"[36] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars, saying "Pierre Coffin (who voices the Minions) and co-director Kyle Balda keep the plot spinning merrily. Pharrell Williams contributes five new songs to the mix, including the hummable "There's Something Special." It's no mystery why Illumination's franchise is still something special after three go-rounds – the box-office gross is a whopping $1.5 billion and counting."[37]

Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'B' grade, saying "What shines through is the visual wit and innate sweetness of the storytelling, and Carell’s cackling, cueball-skulled misanthrope — a (mostly) reformed scoundrel who can still have his cake, and arsenic too."[38] Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying "The film has to rush at the end, to wrap up all these different stories, and it still leaves one of them open-ended."[39]

Box office[edit]
As of November 18, 2017, Despicable Me 3 has grossed $264.2 million in the United States and Canada and $767.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $1.032 billion, against a production budget of $80 million.[5] On September 8, it passed the $1 billion threshold, becoming the second Despicable Me film (after Minions), second non-Disney-animated film (after Minions), third film of 2017 (after Beauty and the Beast and The Fate of the Furious), and the sixth animated film (after Toy Story 3, Frozen, Minions, Zootopia, and Finding Dory) to pass the mark. It became the first film since The Fate of the Furious (also a Universal property) in April 2017 to make over a billion dollars.[40]

In North America, the film opened alongside The House and Baby Driver, as well as the wide expansion of The Beguiled, and was projected to gross $85–95 million in its opening weekend. It played in 4,529 theaters, setting the record for widest release of all time, beating the amount set by The Twilight Saga: Eclipse in 2010.[41] It made $4.1 million from Thursday night previews, down slightly from the $4.7 million of the second film and $6.2 million made by Minions, and $29.2 million on its first day. It went on to debut to $72.4 million, slightly below expectations and the lowest of the series since the first film, but still topped the box office and was the 4th-best opening for Illumination.[31] It also opened to more than the next five films did combined (Baby Driver's $20.6 million, Transformers: The Last Knight's $16.9 million, Wonder Woman's $15.7 million, Cars 3's $9.7 million and The House's $8.7 million).[7] In its second weekend the film grossed $33.6 million (a drop of 53.6%, more than the previous Despicable Me films but similar to Minions), finishing second at the box office behind newcomer Spider-Man: Homecoming ($117 million).[42]

Internationally the film was released in five markets on June 16, 2017, and grossed $9.9 million in its opening weekend.[43] In its third week of release the film opened in 46 more markets, grossing $95.6 million.[7]
